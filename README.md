This program uses the `yfinance` module to download and clean data from Yahoo Finance, then uses the `numpy` and `pandas` modules to calculate the covariance matrix, mean daily returns, and number of portfolios. It then uses the `matplotlib` module to plot an efficient frontier graph. 

The program takes a list of stocks, a start date, and an end date as inputs. It then downloads and cleans the data from Yahoo Finance, calculates the covariance matrix, mean daily returns, and number of portfolios. Finally it plots an efficient frontier graph with the maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio and minimum volatility portfolio highlighted.
